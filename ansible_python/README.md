Create a custom module with Ansible-Python

Folder structure
It is important to know the folder and file structure before we begin to create a custom module. 
Check below image for reference. 
What we need to work on is main.yaml and testing.py under library folder.


You can check more in detail about the custom modules in Ansible Documentation. There is much more that can be done with custom modules.
