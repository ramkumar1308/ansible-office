Create a custom module with Ansible-Python

Folder structure
It is important to know the folder and file structure before we begin to create a custom module. Check below image for reference. What we need to work on is main.yaml and testing.py under library folder.
root@ubuntu:~/ANSIBLEtesting# tree
.
└── playbooks
├── library
│ └── testing.py
└── main.yaml
2 directories, 2 files

You can check more in detail about the custom modules in Ansible Documentation. There is much more that can be done with custom modules.
